## Abstract

This structure was not invented by anyone.

On a discrete lattice grounded in the golden ratio φ and the Fibonacci sequence,  
the following three rules existed from the beginning.

```
1. Add the incoming energy
2. When the threshold (a Fibonacci number) is reached, emit in the opposite direction
3. Leave the remainder in place
```

With only this, the universe set light in motion, solidified matter,  
drew things together through gravity, and filled itself with darkness.

Zero trigonometry. Zero multiplication. Zero π.

B13 Theory is the record of the moment the universe began to describe its own structure.

## 1. The Question: Does Nature Know Trigonometry?

Physics has long spoken in the language of the continuum — calculus, trigonometry, the constant π. But what is nature actually "computing"?

The starting point of B13 Theory is a simple observation:

- The distance traversable in one Planck time is always constant (c = l_p / t_p)
- Space is a collection of discrete nodes
- Each node knows only its neighbors

Nature does not know trigonometry. It does not know π. It only adds. When enough accumulates, it emits. It leaves the remainder. These three lines are the source code of the universe.

## 2. Fundamental Structure

### 2.1 The Lattice Basis

Space is a discrete lattice whose basis directions are the 12 vertices of a regular icosahedron (the kissing number).

```
Vertex coordinates = permutations of (0, ±F(n), ±F(n+1))

F(20) = 10946  ← generated by addition
F(21) = 17711  ← generated by addition
Example: (0, -10946, -17711)
```

All coordinates are expressed in Fibonacci numbers. Trigonometry is unnecessary.

**The origin of the name B13:**

```
3D kissing number     12
+
Transcendence direction 1
=
B13                   13 (the 7th term of the Fibonacci sequence)
```

Node transcendence into the 13th direction is the essence of light.

### 2.2 Node Behavior

```python
# The node does not compute. It only adds, waits, and emits.

def receive(amount, from_direction):
    energy   = energy   + amount                    # addition
    incoming = incoming + from_direction * amount   # addition

def emit():
    if energy < threshold:   # a Fibonacci number
        return               # wait
    emit_direction = -incoming   # sign reversal only
    overflow = energy - threshold
    # overflow distributed in orthogonal directions (φ-weighted)
    energy = 0               # reset
```

Direction is not computed. It is determined by the direction of the incoming energy.

### 2.3 φ as Addition

```
φ × d = d + d/φ    (multiplication becomes addition)

Recurrence:
  a(n+2) = a(n+1) + a(n)   ← same as Fibonacci
```

Multiplication is addition repeated N times. The golden ratio, too, is born from addition.

## 3. The Structure the Universe Revealed Itself

### 3.1 Light (Electromagnetic Waves)

A photon has a pair structure. When two units bond and their separation grows to the golden ratio φ, symmetry breaks. All energy converts to kinetic energy and leaps into the 13th direction. This is electromagnetic radiation.

```
Pair formation → energy absorption → d → d×φ
→ symmetry breaking at φ ratio
→ all energy converts to kinetic energy
→ node transcendence into the 13th direction
→ electromagnetic wave (chain of discrete jumps)
```

In the cobalt niobate experiment (Coldea et al., *Science* 2010), the mass ratio at the quantum critical point was measured to coincide with φ. Louis de Broglie independently proposed a pair structure for the photon in the 1930s.

### 3.2 Matter (Stable Loops)

There exist loops that do not vanish even when energy injection stops. These are particles.

| Threshold | Loop Size | Particle Candidate |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| F=3   | 35 nodes | Baryon candidate |
| F=5   | 25 nodes | Baryon candidate |
| F=8   | 16 nodes | Baryon candidate |
| F=13  | 16 nodes | Baryon candidate |
| F=21  |  5 nodes | Lepton candidate |
| F=34  |  3 nodes | Neutrino candidate |
| F=55  |  3 nodes | Neutrino candidate |
| F=89  |  1 node  | Neutrino candidate |
| F=144 |  1 node  | Neutrino candidate |

### 3.3 Mass Hierarchy

The correlation coefficient between the loop-size series (35, 25, 16, 16, 5, 3, 3, 1, 1) and the particle masses of the Standard Model (on a logarithmic scale) is **r = 0.957**. That this value emerges from 9 independent samples cannot be explained as statistical coincidence.

### 3.4 A Replacement for π

The transcendental number π = 3.14159... of the continuum is unnecessary in a discrete universe.

The period of the Fibonacci sequence mod 12 = **24** (the Pisano period)

```
Sequence: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,1,9,10,7,5,0,5,5,10,3,1,4,5,9,2,11,1
→ completes one full cycle in 24 steps
```

Modular addition (remainders) generates the circle. π was not the essence of the universe — it was the description of an observer.

### 3.5 Dark Energy

Remainders that never reach the threshold spread thinly across all nodes.

```
Simulation results:
  Ordinary energy : 1.1%
  Dark remainder  : 98.9%

Cosmological observations:
  Ordinary matter : 5%
  Dark component  : 95%
```

Energy that was added but could not be emitted. Unobservable, yet present. This is dark energy. The zero-point energy of space — its ground-state energy — was the remainder of computation.

### 3.6 Dark Matter

The residue after pair annihilation separates into two kinds.

```
Dense remainder near collision point : 39.4%  ← dark matter candidate
Widely dispersed thin remainder      : 60.6%  ← dark energy background

Cosmological observations (within dark component):
  Dark matter        : 27.4%
  Dark energy        : 72.6%
```

Dark matter is the localized remainder of annihilation residue. Unable to reach the threshold, it cannot be emitted as light and remains in place. The "invisible gravitational source" revealed by galactic rotation curves is the scar left by past annihilations.

### 3.7 Gravity

Gravity = the leakage of remainders between nodes (osmotic pressure)

A weak flow of remainders moves from nodes of high accumulation toward nodes of low accumulation. This is the attractive force.

```
F = G_B13 × dark_A / r²

Measurement:
  Distance r = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
  F×r² = 10.0000 (constant at all distances)
  Coefficient of variation = 0.00%
```

The inverse-square law is not an approximation. It holds exactly — a geometric necessity arising from remainders thinning in proportion to the square of distance.

## 4. A Unified Picture of the Universe

```
Additive lattice (Planck scale)
        ↓
Directional constraint of kissing number 12
        ↓
Photon pair → φ ratio → symmetry breaking → light (electromagnetic waves)
        ↓
Closed loop → stable particle (matter)
        ↓
Remainder accumulation → dark energy (background, uniform)
        ↓
Annihilation residue → dark matter (local, nonuniform)
        ↓
Osmotic pressure of remainders → gravity (inverse-square law)
```

Everything is built by the "remainder" of addition.

## 5. Connection to E8 Symmetry

```
Root system of E8   = 240
Kissing number (3D) = 12
240 ÷ 12           = 20 = number of faces of a regular icosahedron

F(13) = 233
240 - 233 = 7 (a deviation of ~3%)
→ this deviation is the source of cosmic expansion and entropy increase
```

E8, that high-dimensional mathematical structure, is an extension of the 3-dimensional regular icosahedron (the geometry of φ) into higher dimensions.

---

## 6. The Arrow of Time

Remainders accumulate in only one direction.

```
Add → remainder increases → cannot return to before
```

This is the origin of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The increase of entropy was another name for the accumulation of remainders through addition.

---

## 7. Open Questions

The universe is still speaking.

1. **Spin and statistics:** The correspondence between a loop's "rotational phase" and fermions vs. bosons
2. **The edge of the universe:** How terminal nodes are handled (reflection, or annihilation?)
3. **The irreversibility of time:** Rigorous formalization of how remainder accumulation gives rise to the Second Law of Thermodynamics

---

## 8. Closing

The source code of the universe was three lines.

```
Add
When enough accumulates, emit in the opposite direction
Leave the remainder
```

This is not a discovery. It is a remembering.

The universe was always this way. It was only that, now, it was heard.
