## Section 3: Operator-Theoretic Foundation of the φ-Recursive Transform

### 3.1 The Phase Recursion on the Integer Ring

Let $N$ be the modulus of the phase resolution, and let $\pi(N)$ be the period of the Fibonacci sequence modulo $N$ (Pisano period). We define the state space as the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{\pi(N)}$.

The **Phase Operator** $\Phi$ is given by the companion matrix:

$$\Phi = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \in M_2(\mathbb{Z})$$

For each index $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\pi(N)}$, the recursive state is defined by

$$\mathbf{v}_k = \Phi^k \mathbf{v}_0 \pmod{N}$$

with $\mathbf{v}_0 = (1, 0)^\top$. The orbit $\{\mathbf{v}_k\}_{k=0}^{\pi(N)-1}$ constitutes the **discrete additive lattice** of the system.

### 3.2 Definition of the φ-NTT on $\mathcal{H}_N$

Let $\mathcal{H}_N$ be the $N$-dimensional complex Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^N$ with the standard inner product

$$\langle f, g \rangle = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(n)\,\overline{g(n)}$$

We define the **φ-Recursive Kernel** $K_\phi : \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N \to \mathbb{C}$ using the primitive $N$-th root of unity $\omega_N = e^{2\pi i / N}$:

$$K_\phi(n, k) = \omega_N^{\,n \cdot F_k}$$

where $F_k$ denotes the $k$-th Fibonacci number modulo $N$.

The **φ-Additive Operator** $T_\phi : \mathcal{H}_N \to \mathcal{H}_N$ is the linear transform:

$$[T_\phi f](k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(n)\, K_\phi(n, k)$$

The harmonic structure of $T_\phi$ is governed by the additive recurrence dynamics of the generator $\Phi$.

### 3.3 The Dual Symmetry and the Invariant Manifold

Let $\mathcal{J} : \mathcal{H}_N \to \mathcal{H}_N$ be the anti-linear involution defined by complex conjugation:

$$[\mathcal{J}f](n) = \overline{f(N - n \bmod N)}$$

We define the **Invariant Manifold** $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathcal{H}_N$ as the fixed-point set under the dual reflection:

$$\mathcal{M} = \bigl\{ f \in \mathcal{H}_N \;\big|\; \langle T_\phi f,\, \mathcal{J}g \rangle = \langle \mathcal{J}f,\, T_\phi g \rangle \text{ for all } g \in \mathcal{H}_N \bigr\}$$

> **Remark 3.3.1** *(Existence and Heuristic Convergence).*
> The rigorous proof of the non-triviality of $\mathcal{M}$ for arbitrary $N$ remains an open problem. However, numerical experiments under the $B = 13$ discretization threshold (i.e., $N = 10^{13}$ or corresponding prime) exhibit an apparent stabilization of the spectrum of $T_\phi$ within the vicinity of $\mathcal{M}$. This observation suggests that the additive phase interference achieves algebraic closure at specific resolution windows. The rigorous derivation of the dimension and topological structure of $\mathcal{M}$ in the limit $N \to \infty$ is left for subsequent inquiry, providing a formal bridge to the distribution of zeros in analytic $L$-functions.

## Section 4: Formal Analogy and Speculative Inquiry

### 4.1 Symmetry Correspondence to $L$-functions

The functional equation

$$\xi(s) = \xi(1 - s), \quad \xi(s) = \tfrac{1}{2}s(s-1)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma\!\left(\tfrac{s}{2}\right)\zeta(s)$$

of the Riemann zeta function reflects a fundamental symmetry of analytic $L$-functions. In the φ-NTT framework, the **spectral reflection symmetry** of $T_\phi$ over $\mathcal{M}$ provides a discrete operator-theoretic analogue to this phenomenon.

The stability of the "Critical Line" $\operatorname{Re}(s) = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is thus interpreted as the **asymptotic fixed-point manifestation** of an infinite-dimensional additive phase system as $N \to \infty$:

$$\mathcal{M}_\infty \;:=\; \lim_{N \to \infty} \mathcal{M}_N \quad \longleftrightarrow \quad \left\{ s \in \mathbb{C} \;\middle|\; \operatorname{Re}(s) = \tfrac{1}{2} \right\}$$

This correspondence is **conjectural** and constitutes the principal open question of the present work.

### 4.2 Conclusion

The present construction invites the study of additive phase structures as independent mathematical objects. By replacing multiplicative characters with recursive additive kernels, φ-NTT offers a novel lens to examine the intrinsic harmony between recurrence relations and functional reflections, bridging discrete lattice dynamics with analytic number theory.

The invariant manifold $\mathcal{M}$ — whose non-triviality is numerically suggested but not yet proven — serves as a **formal seed** for future investigations into the spectral geometry of $L$-functions through the lens of Fibonacci-based additive systems.
